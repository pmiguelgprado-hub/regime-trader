# Handoff — regime-trader ML v2 (Phase 2)

## 1. Goal of next session
Build **ML v2 Phase 2**: a cross-sectional **feature panel** (rows = S&P 500 names, cols =
momentum + the quality factors) for the whole universe, loaded via **bulk download / cache**
(not per-ticker REST — see blocker). This panel feeds Phase 3 (the model). Stay phase-by-phase
with a checkpoint after each (Pablo's explicit choice).

## 2. State of play
**v1 book = DONE + LIVE on paper.** Cross-sectional momentum ranker (alpha) + HMM `vol_rank`
gross overlay (risk), monthly rebalance, sector cap, dashboard. Architecture rationale, the
3 falsified avenues, and "why this won't be known until ≥12mo forward" are in the analysis
docs (§5) — do not re-litigate.
- **Executed on paper:** daily SPY bot retired (`launchctl unload …runonce`); 50 book orders
  submitted; **market opened mid-session and they began filling** (cash 85.6k→82.6k). Monthly
  agent `com.regimetrader.rebalance` loaded (fires 1st of month).
- **Sector cap** live: top sector held to 30% (was 44% IT). Config `cross_sectional.max_sector_fraction`.
- **Dashboard** live at `localhost:8501`: stock-picker dropdown + per-company return panel +
  "Cross-Sectional Book" panel. Server runs in background; restart = `streamlit run monitoring/streamlit_app.py`.
- **ML v2 Phase 1 = DONE:** `core/fundamental_features.py` (gross_profitability/ROE/ROA/margin/
  leverage, **point-in-time** via Publish Date) + `data/simfin_data.py` (SimFin v3 loader).
  Proven on real AAPL/NVDA. 263 tests green.

## 3. Open decisions (next agent must resolve)
- **Data scaling (BLOCKER):** SimFin free tier 429s after ~10 per-ticker calls → can't fetch
  ~500 names that way. Decide: (a) `simfin` **python package** bulk dataset download *[lean — built for this]*; (b) local cache (fetch monthly, store); (c) yfinance fundamentals. Quota resets (~daily).
- **Value factor:** current features need no market cap. Adding value (earnings/book yield)
  needs shares outstanding (field not yet located in SimFin BS) — decide whether to add.
- **Model (Phase 3):** start with gradient-boosted trees (GKX), NOT a neural net. Keep degrees
  of freedom low — overfit is THE project risk.
- **Honest framing (locked):** free history = current-constituent filings → survivorship-biased
  training → v2 is FORWARD-deployed, judged by the **same pre-registered gate**, never a
  backtest edge claim. Validate with walk-forward + DSR/PBO (Phase 4).

## 4. Action items (immediate)
- **Rotate the SimFin API key** — it leaked into a test's stdout this session (now in transcript). Then update `.env` `SIMFIN_API_KEY`.
- **Monday:** verify the 49 book buys filled (some may reject on buying-power; re-run `python main.py --rebalance --execute` to top up). The Monday fills are the *pre-cap* book; the sector cap applies from the next rebalance.

## 5. Skills to use
- `claude-mem:mem-search` / read the memory file first — fastest way to absorb full context.
- `superpowers:test-driven-development` — every module here was TDD'd; keep it (the gate discipline).
- `td-train-test-split` + `statistical-analyst` — Phase 3/4 model split + DSR/PBO significance.
- `superpowers:verification-before-completion` — run the real path, not py_compile (this session's repeated lesson: caught NameError + vol_rank glue + collision only by running it).
- `handoff:cs-handoff` — to hand off again at the next checkpoint.
